# WHY THIS EXISTS, "i feel a lot of the time
# like i have a bunch of employees and they're all named clade and i want to
# call an all-hands and say hey, you guys you need to be using backoff, and
# jitter, because bad things happen when you don't ... and the thing is i
# can't. i can add stuff to claude.md but that only matters some of the time
# and usually at the wrong time. so we should probably try to do this in a
# library everyone owns, so there's no confusion about whether and how to do
# it."
#
# dodo got src/net.ts the same day. This is its sibling, and it exists because
# the rule has to hold in any language that joins the mesh -- a policy that is
# only enforced in TypeScript is a policy the Python service is exempt from,
# and the Python service is the one doing the heavy fetching.
#
# KINGFISHER IS THE SERVICE THAT MOST NEEDS IT. dodo's calls are almost all
# in-cluster. Ours go over the public internet to USGS, GIBS, OpenSky and the
# weather services -- people who can and will block us. the operator, on wrapping
# them: "yes those also should be wrapped because if we make them mad we will
# get banned!" A retry storm against a government endpoint is not a latency
# problem, it is an access problem, and access is not something we can restore
# by fixing the code afterwards.
#
# FULL JITTER, deliberately. sleep = random(0, min(cap, base * 2^attempt)).
# Not fixed backoff, which synchronises every caller onto the same schedule and
# rebuilds the herd one beat later. Not equal jitter, which still leaves a floor
# everyone shares. Full jitter spreads retries across the whole window and is
# the only one of the three that decorrelates independent callers -- which
# matters here because gibsd, openskyd and weatherd all wake on their own
# timers and would otherwise line up the moment one provider has a bad minute.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is transport only. Decompression stays in providers.py
# (gzip and brotli, both learned the hard way from CDNs that compress whatever
# you asked for), and the flag gates stay with their callers. This layer knows
# about attempts, deadlines and status codes, and nothing else.
